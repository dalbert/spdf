spdf is a command-line utility for quickly writing PDF's from URL's, html
files, or a mixture of both.

spdf plays nice with other command-line utilities, meaning that piped input and
redirected output is both supported and encouraged.

PDF conversion is done by using [iText][1] and [flyingsaucer][2]. More about
how to use the program can be found on [spdf's github][3].
